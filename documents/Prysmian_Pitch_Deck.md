## 1. The Challenge: Fragmented Onboarding
In a global organization like Prysmian, new employees often face:
*   **Information Overload**: scattered PDF guides, emails, and SharePoint links.
*   **Inconsistency**: Different regions using outdated or conflicting instructions.
*   **IT Bottlenecks**: High volume of helpdesk tickets for basic setups (MFA, VPN, Outlook).
*   **Lack of Engagement**: Static documents fail to engage the modern workforce.

## 2. The Solution: A Unified Digital Hub
We have developed the **Prysmian Induction App**, a centralized, web-based portal that guides employees step-by-step through their digital onboarding.

**Core Philosophy:**
> "One Source of Truth. Accessible Anywhere. Always Updated."
